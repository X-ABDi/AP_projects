cin.ignore();
lineStream = stringstream();
lineStream.str();

using iterator for the second loop to keep track of the vector even when the main loop restarts

// personal access token
// still uncomfortable with branches, checkout and local or remote branches

strangly I declared a vector in a function out of main, filled it and pushed it to a vector of vectors, it just didn't 
    disapear or disrtuct after quiting the function. why?

when using for (i : vector) I cann't use i.end() with operator == or != . why? --> problem solved by using .back(),
    actually make sense
