about git : 
    if you want to over write local files with the latest version of remote repo 
    you should first " fetch --all " , this command downloads all files without 
    any merge or rebase. then " reset --hard " to change all files.
    if you wanna keep commits you can create a new branch then checkout to the main 
    then do the reset thing.

still conflicts with iterators when the vector stores pointers. unable to access 
    content even with *(it).
    i probably use int for accessing indexes.
